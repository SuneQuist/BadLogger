### BadLogger

So the keymouse_log.txt file is just dumped in the directory that the ./f.exe is executed in.
Mouse Input:       M[int],X[int],Y[INT]
Sleep Input:       S[int]
Keyboard Input:    K[int]

There is a small 3 seconds window to interact with your game else it won't register the input. And I'm too lazy to make a device driver, since I just learned win32 api yesterday evening.

Have an awesome day!
